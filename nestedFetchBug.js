In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with deeply nested data fetching.  If a server component makes multiple data fetches in sequence, each dependent on the result of the previous one, and one of the intermediate fetches fails, the error handling might not properly propagate back up the call stack. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as a silent failure or an error being thrown in an unexpected location.
